# Train-Operating-System

Goal:
The goal is that the train (red dot) should go to the location of the wagon (yellow dot) and return to the original location of the train. During this procedure, you need to avoid collisions with Zamboni (black dot). You also need to make sure that Zamboni does not go into a dead-end.

Note: You cannot use any in-built 'C' functions such as malloc, calloc etc.

Hint: Read the "Train OS description" before looking into the code.
